{ question: "What is the difference between iconic and echoic memory?", answer: "Iconic memory is visual, while echoic memory is auditory." },
{ question: "What are the three types of long-term memory?", answer: "Episodic (specific events), semantic (general knowledge), and procedural (skills)." },
{ question: "Define retrieval cue and give an example.", answer: "A stimulus that helps access memories, like a familiar song triggering a memory." },

{ question: "Explain the concept of blocking in memory.", answer: "It refers to the temporary inaccessibility of stored information." },
{ question: "What is the role of maintenance rehearsal in memory?", answer: "It keeps information active in working memory for short-term recall." },
          
{ question: "Who is known for developing the concept of classical conditioning?", answer: "Ivan Pavlov." },
{ question: "Define neutral stimulus in classical conditioning.", answer: "A stimulus that does not initially trigger a response." },
{ question: "What is operant conditioning and who developed it?", answer: "Learning influenced by outcomes; developed by B.F. Skinner." },
{ question: "What is the difference between positive and negative reinforcement?", answer: "Positive adds a stimulus; negative removes an aversive stimulus to strengthen behavior." },
{ question: "Name two schedules of reinforcement in operant conditioning.", answer: "Fixed ratio and variable interval." },
{ question: "Define shaping in operant conditioning.", answer: "Reinforcing successive approximations of a desired behavior." },
{ question: "What is observational learning?", answer: "Learning through observing and imitating others." },
{ question: "Who introduced social learning theory?", answer: "Albert Bandura." },
{ question: "What is extinction in classical conditioning?", answer: "The gradual disappearance of a conditioned response." },
{ question: "What is the acquisition curve in learning?", answer: "A graph showing the speed at which a conditioned response is learned." },
{ question: "Explain systematic desensitization and give an example.", answer: "Gradually exposing someone to a feared stimulus, e.g., fear of flying." },
{ question: "What is stimulus generalization?", answer: "Responding to a stimulus similar to the conditioned stimulus." },
          
{ question: "What is infinite generativity in language?", answer: "The ability to create endless meaningful sentences." },
{ question: "What is the critical period for language acquisition?", answer: "Between 18 months and the onset of puberty." },

{ question: "What is the gambler's fallacy?", answer: "Believing past events influence future outcomes in random processes." },
{ question: "How do emotions influence decision-making?", answer: "Emotions can distort judgments and lead to biases like overconfidence." },
{ question: "What is confirmatory bias?", answer: "Favoring information that supports existing beliefs." },
{ question: "Define problem-solving and list the key steps.", answer: "Problem-solving involves analyzing, formulating, evaluating, and implementing solutions." },
          
{ question: "What is the self-medication theory for PTSD and SUD?", answer: "Substance use alleviates PTSD symptoms like avoidance and arousal." },
{ question: "What is the high-risk hypothesis for SUD preceding PTSD?", answer: "Substance use leads to high-risk behavior, increasing trauma exposure." },
{ question: "Define the susceptibility hypothesis.", answer: "Substance use increases vulnerability to PTSD post-trauma." },
{ question: "What are the two indirect variables in PTSD-SUD comorbidity?", answer: "Childhood trauma and lack of social support." },
{ question: "How does childhood trauma impact PTSD and SUD?", answer: "Trauma during development increases symptom severity and SUD risk." },
{ question: "What is the integrated model for PTSD and SUD treatment?", answer: "Treating trauma and substance use simultaneously." },
{ question: "What is the sequential model for PTSD-SUD treatment?", answer: "SUD is treated first, followed by PTSD treatment." },
{ question: "What is the main challenge posed by mental health stigmatization?", answer: "It prevents PSP from seeking treatment due to fear of consequences." },
{ question: "What is label avoidance in mental health stigma?", answer: "Ignoring symptoms to avoid negative labels." },
{ question: "How does perceived social support impact PTSD symptoms?", answer: "Low perceived support is linked to more severe symptoms." },
{ question: "Why is suicide risk higher for PSP with PTSD and SUD?", answer: "Factors include less fear of death, sleep disturbances, and access to lethal means." },
{ question: "What future research is needed for PTSD and SUD in PSP?", answer: "Studies on critical incident stress management and integrated treatments." },
